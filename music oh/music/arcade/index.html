        <h2>"Arcade"

            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

            A broken heart is all that's left
            I'm still fixing all the cracks
            Lost a couple of pieces when
            I carried it, carried it, carried it home
            I'm afraid of all I am
            My mind feels like a foreign land
            Silence ringing inside my head
            Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

            I've spent all of the love I saved
            We were always a losing game
            Small-town boy in a big arcade
            I got addicted to a losing game

            Ooh, ooh
            All I know, all I know
            Loving you is a losing game

            How many pennies in the slot?
            Giving us up didn't take a lot
            I saw the end 'fore it begun
            Still I carried, I carried, I carry on

            Ooh, ooh
            All I know, all I know
            Loving you is a losing game
            Ooh, ooh
            All I know, all I know
            Loving you is a losing game

            I don't need your games, game over
            Get me off this roller-coaster

            Ooh, ooh
            All I know, all I know
            Loving you is a losing game
            Ooh, ooh
            All I know, all I know
            Loving you is a losing game

            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</h2>
