        <h2>Oh, angel sent from up above
            You know you make my world light up
            When I was down, when I was hurt
            You came to lift me up

            Life is a drink, and love's a drug
            Oh, now I think I must be miles up
            When I was a river dried up
            You came to rain a flood

            You said, "drink from me, drink from me"
            When I was so thirsty
            Pour on a symphony
            Oh, now I just can't get enough

            Put your wings on me, wings on me
            When I was so heavy
            Pour on a symphony, oh
            When I'm low, low, low, low

            Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
            Got me feeling drunk and high
            So high, so high
            Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
            Now I'm feeling drunk and high
            So high, so high (Wooh!)

            Wooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Wooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

            Oh, angel sent from up above
            I feel you coursing through my blood
            Life is a drink, your love's about
            To make the stars come out

            Put your wings on me, wings on me
            When I was so heavy
            Pour on a symphony
            When I'm low, low, low, low

            Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
            Got me feeling drunk and high
            So high, so high
            Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
            Now I'm feeling drunk and high
            So high, so high

            Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
            La la la la la la
            So high, so high
            Ah, oh-ah, oh-ah
            Now I'm feeling drunk and high
            So high, so high
